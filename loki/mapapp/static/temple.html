                            The Virudhagiriswarar Temple is a Hindu temple in the town of Virudhachalam, Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, India. 
                            The presiding deity Virudhagiriswarar is revered in Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. 
                            The temple gives its name to the town of Virudhachalam. 
                            The temple is famed for the legend of Shiva forming as a mountain heeding to the prayers of Brahma.

                            Virudhagirswarar temple is a part of the series of temples built by Sembiyan Mahadevi, the Chola queen along the banks of river Kaveri. 
                            It has several inscriptions dating back to the Chola period. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., 
                            and three yearly festivals on its calendar. 
                            The annual Brahmotsavam (prime festival), Masi Magam, is attended by thousands of devotees from far and near. 
                            The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
